# Branch and Feature Skill

Create a new feature branch from the current branch and immediately start working on the described feature.

## Usage

```
/baf <branch-name> <feature description...>
```

The first argument is the branch name (will be prefixed with `feat/` if no prefix is given). Everything after is the feature description — what to build.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Arguments
- **First word**: Branch name (e.g., `merch-store`)
- **Rest**: Feature description (e.g., "add a merch store page with product grid")
- If the branch name doesn't already have a prefix (`feat/`, `fix/`, `learn/`, etc.), prepend `feat/`

### 2. Ensure Clean State
```bash
git status
```
- If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user and stop — don't create the branch with dirty state
- If on a detached HEAD, warn and stop

### 3. Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feat/<branch-name>
```

### 4. Confirm & Build
- Confirm the branch was created: `git branch --show-current`
- Tell the user what branch you're on and what you're about to build
- **Then immediately start working on the feature** using the description provided
- Treat the description as the user's instructions — plan and implement accordingly

### 5. After Implementation
- Run `pnpm run typecheck` and `pnpm run lint` to verify
- Do NOT auto-commit — let the user decide when to commit (they can use `/commit` or `/cap`)

## Branch Name Conventions

| Prefix | Auto-applied when |
|--------|-------------------|
| `feat/` | No prefix given (default) |
| `fix/` | User provides `fix/` prefix |
| `learn/` | User provides `learn/` prefix |
| `experiment/` | User provides `experiment/` prefix |

## Examples

```
/baf merch-store add a merch store page with product grid
→ creates feat/merch-store, starts building

/baf fix/broken-publish the blog publish flow hangs on large posts
→ creates fix/broken-publish, starts debugging and fixing

/baf dark-mode add a dark mode toggle using Tailwind dark variant
→ creates feat/dark-mode, starts implementing
```
