# Learning Phases

## Phase 1: Understanding What You Built (Part 1)
- [ ] Electron architecture (main, renderer, preload, IPC)
- [ ] React component tree and hooks usage in Xun
- [ ] CodeMirror 6 editor integration
- [ ] Tailwind CSS and styling approach
- [ ] Vite + Electron build pipeline
- [ ] Blog publishing system (GitHub API, Cloudflare)
- [ ] Testing with Playwright

## Phase 2: Frontend Fundamentals Deep Dive (Parts 2)
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript mastery (event loop, closures, async, type system)
- [ ] React deep dive (fiber, hooks internals, performance, patterns)
- [ ] CSS & layout mastery (box model, flexbox, grid, responsive)
- [ ] Browser internals (rendering pipeline, DOM, Web APIs, security)

## Phase 3: CS Fundamentals (Part 3)
- [ ] Data structures (arrays, trees, graphs, heaps, tries)
- [ ] Algorithms (sorting, searching, DP, greedy, backtracking)
- [ ] System design (scaling, databases, caching, distributed systems)

## Phase 4: Engineering Practices (Part 4)
- [ ] Testing mastery (unit, component, E2E, TDD, property-based)
- [ ] Code quality & architecture (SOLID, patterns, refactoring)
- [ ] DevOps & deployment (Git advanced, CI/CD, packaging)

## Phase 5: FAANG Interview Prep (Part 5)
- [ ] Coding interview practice (pattern-based problem solving)
- [ ] System design mock interviews
- [ ] Behavioral preparation (STAR method, leadership principles)

## Phase 6: Advanced & Elective (Part 6)
- [ ] Performance engineering
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Node.js & backend fundamentals

## Background Skills Assessment
- [x] QA expertise (~15 years) - testing instincts, how software breaks
- [x] Light frontend experience (~5 years) - practical exposure, some gaps
- [x] MS in Software Engineering - theoretical foundation
- [x] Built Xun via vibe-coding - working app, needs deep understanding
- [ ] Deep React/TypeScript understanding
- [ ] Electron internals knowledge
- [ ] DSA interview readiness
- [ ] System design interview readiness
